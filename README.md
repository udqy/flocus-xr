# flocus-xr
XR Pomodoro Timer

The goal is to create a flocus.io in XR

### Roadmap:
- Configurable times
- Make it a widget rather than a standalone app
- Make the app MR with Passthrough API
- Replace the clock with something much more interactive and rewarding
- Create Vibes (jazz, beach, etc.)
- Spotify API for playback
- Breaktime activities like breathing

### About:
- Built in Unity `6000.0.38f1`
- Basic Pomodoro clock works
- Is currently VR-only
- The clock itself can be grabbed and moved in the workspace
- Tested on Meta Quest 2/3/Pro
